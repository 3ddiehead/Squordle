CURRENT ISSUE: while destroying keys, if item is placed shuckle freezes
POSSIBLE SOLUTION: queue shuckle target, focus, action

QUEUE ---
1. store the target pos
2. store the shuckle's behavior (based on 1)
3. if targetReached, execute behavior, pop queue
4. if queue != empty, push [target, shuckleInfo]
5. if queue == empty, still push or no need?

This would allow the shuckle to complete current action

ONLY TIME QUEUE is in use, when key or item are targets NEVER mouse
